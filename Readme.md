# Furkot Trip Planner Widget

  Embed [Furkot] trip planner widget on your website and give your visitors easy way to add your places to their trips.

## Installation

  Install with [npm]:

    $ npm install --save trip-planner

  Install with [component]:

    $ component install furkot/trip-planner

  Load with a standalone script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.furkot.com/scripts/furkot-trip-planner.min.js" defer></script>
```

## API

  [Furkot] trip planner widget displays trip itineraries and supports adding places from any website.

  The guide to integration options is [here][help].

### initialization

  When used with a module bundling framework like [browserify] and [component]:

```javascript
var furkotTripPlanner = require('trip-planner');
```

  When loaded as a standalone, the script instantiates the global variable `furkotTripPlaner`.

### auto discovery

  If elements executing HTTP GET or POST to Furkot (anchors or forms linking to `https://trips.furkot.com/trip`) or elements [annotated with microdata][furkot-microdata] exist on a page when its document is ready, they will be automatically discovered and modified to activate [Furkot] trip planner widget upon click instead of redirecting to [Furkot].

  When loaded as a stanalone script, nothing further needs to be done. In case of a bundling framework, just invoking `require` is sufficient to perform the auto discovery.
  
### dynamically added elements

  If more elements are added dynamically to the page, they can be discovered and modified to activate [Furkot] trip planner widget upon click by triggering the discovery process:
  
```javascript
var container = ... // container with elements to activate the widget on click

furkotTripPlanner(container);
```

The `container` is a single DOM element that contains dynamically added elements. It can be the `document` to process the entire page. The elements that are already discovered and modified are ignored.

### activate widget programmatically

Instead of using DOM elements to pass parameters, it is possible to activate [Furkot] trip planner widget programmatically by invoking the `.plan(stops)` method passing stops to be added to visitor's trip. `stops` is an `Array` of objects with `name`, `description`, `coordinates` (lat, lon), `address`, `url` and `duration` (in milliseconds). Only `name` and `coordinates` (or `address` in absence of `coordinates`) are required.

```javascript
var planner = furkotTripPlanner();

var stops = [{
  name: 'Time Square',
  coordinates: {
    lat: 40.7577,
    lon: -73.9857
  }
}, {
  name: 'Metropolitan Museum',
  coordinates: {
    lat: 40.7789,
    lon: -73.9637
  }
}];

planner.plan(stops);
```

See how it works with [Nooreq].
